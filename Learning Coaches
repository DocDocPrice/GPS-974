The learning coaches I chose to guide my professional development was the stoic and Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the Nobel Laureate Dr. Jennifer Doudna. I chose to
pursue coaching through a literary means as I was unable to make contact with my desired learning coach. Despite that, these two authors have still provided me with many
lessons. My learning artifact from Marcus Aurelius was his journal, Meditations, which is a fundamental stoic source. From his writings I tried to take home different 
parts of the stoic philosophy, namely the resilience and rationality they promote. I have found that personally, I have been able to manage unfortunate things better 
since reading due to a paradigm shift. I found that approaching things as part of the whole has made poor situations more understandable and improved my resilience.
As for Dr. Doudna, reading her work provides inspiration that small discoveries in unrelated fields can lead to breakthroughs. She worked hard, did good science, and 
followed her hunches. She made one of the greatest discoveries of this century and potentially of humanity to date, the technological basis to rewrite genetic code 
with purpose. This work and the personality behind it provides motivation to follow her path. To be passionate about science and diligent in my work. It encourages me 
to keep working hard and find a path to elevate my research and professional status as high as I can.
