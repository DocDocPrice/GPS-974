This document represents the ongoing work towards the three SMART goals for GPS-974

Specific: Well defined, clear, and unambiguous
Measurable: With specific criteria that measure your progress toward the accomplishment of the goal
Achievable: Attainable and not impossible to achieve
Realistic: Within reach, realistic, and relevant to your life purpose
Timely: With a clearly defined timeline, including a starting date and a target date. The purpose is to create urgency.

Goal 1 (S): I would like to organize and plan my work schedule such that I do an average of < 8 hours of work 
    afterhours per week by the end of the semster. (Wellness and life balance)
M: I will know this goal is achieved if I can have 3 consecutive weeks where this goal is met. I can track my working hours 
    with a timer on my phone and log this time in a spreadsheet to observe its progress.
A: This goal should be achievable if I work at it. I believe that 8 hours is doable and can be spread across the week as
    needed, especially on weekends. I think it would be unreasonable to have 0 hours as it is too inflexible.
R:Achieving less than 8 hours per week should encourage me to work harder during the day and more efficiently in the evenings. 
    Currently, I occupy too much of my time with work and I should make an effort to have more balance with other activities.
T: This will begin on the last week of September and progress indefinetly although I would like to have it acheived and
    maintained prior to the the end of the semester

Goal 2 (S): I would like to have a rough draft of a review paper on something I am not familiar with done by the end of the 
    semester. (Research and project management)
M: I know that this goal will be achieved when I submit the draft to my supervisor for review.
A: I know that this goal is achievable as I am giving myself 2 months to work on it, which should be ample time. I am also 
    partial to the opportunity to coauthor it with a colleage which will strengthen our professional relationship. I have
    collaborated on similar projects in the past so I feel confident on my skills in this field. The largest barriers will
    be other goals and projects and managing my time effectively.
R: This goal is reasonable for the above reasons. It is relevant as it will benefit my career by producing this paper and 
    will make more familiar with this field of research. It will also aquaint me better with library services and the many
    subtleties of writing research papers.
T: This goal starts immediately as I brainstorm a topic and beging my literature review. This goal will be completed in 
    December at the end of the semester.

Goal 3 (S): I would like to keep a journal outlining my experiences as a grad student, updated at-least biweekly, for my 
    first semester (Reflection and interpersonal skills)
M: This goal is measurable by checking if at least two entries are added to this journal every week until the end of the 
    semester. It is expected that some weeks there may be fewer, but the goal is to have at the very least, an average of
    2/week
A: I think this goal is achievable as it requires only a small commitment of time each week and can hopefully develop to 
    build a habit. By setting aside 15 minutes in my calendar, I can leave myself ample time to write and reflect upon my 
    experiences
R: This goal is reasonable as it is only requires a small change in my schedule to implement. I believe it is relevant as
    in my own life, I tend to often live in the present or future, and do not think on the past often enough (unless it is
    embarressing, unfortunately). By reflecting upon my experiences, hopefully I can learn more about what in life brings me 
    joy or sorrow, contentment, or even helps me achieve my goals. It may also be therapeutic to write these down.
T: This goal will begin in the final week of September and progress to the end of the semester where its progress will be 
    evaluated. If the experience is positive or yields some benefit, it may be continued into the new year indefinetly.
