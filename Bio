Hello, my name is Jared. I'm currently an MD/PhD student at the University of Saskatchewan. Though I call the city of Regina my home, Saskatoon is beginning to grow on me
as I look forward to spending the next few years out here. My research project revolves around novel cancer therapies based on genetic susceptibilities indicated by 
various tumor markers. It's certainly hard work but I enjoy it a great deal. When I'm not in lab you can find me rock climbing at the different centres in Saskatoon or 
whipping up some baking in the kitchen. I consider myself fairly adept at pies and cinnamon buns but am always looking to expand my repertoire.
