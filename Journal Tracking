This marks the first passage I’ve written on the subject of being a graduate student. Its been about four months since I’ve started this project and in a scary way
that means I only have 32 months left and by that I mean I only have 28 months left. Time has flown by faster than I can imagine and I feel caught between the world 
of doing too little and doing too much. It is probably better summed by having too few results and too little time in the day. I’ve learned a lot in my brief tenure,
plenty of scientific skills that I wouldn’t have thought available, hell, I learned how to anesthetize a mouse. I know I’m going to have to increase my commitment to 
the this project, and that means learning how to better manage my time. I think my biggest issue is the loss to nothing. Time spend on social media, time spent resting,
time doing leisurely things. Time needed for balancing my mental state but time that I cannot affort to continue to lose. Marcus Aurelius said something along the lines
of a man’s value can be somewhat measured by the merit of his actions. What does it say of my own merit being occupied with work? Or maybe worse, spending it in leisure
without substantial production. One avenue I’d like to keep is leisure reading. I find it calming and has the potential to improve my vocabulary, something necessary in 
this career. I may even gain something along the lines of charisma. I could also try experimenting with time blocks and never violating these rules. Something is going 
to have to give if this is going to work out.

Three days pass and my mind is occupied with the ideas of network and image. By virtue of my position, I have somewhat a secure platform to base the next five years of
my career from, but what comes next and how can I maneuver to ensure my most likely outcome is also my most beneficial. The current stance is to network and build a 
community of people, something I have loathed as an enthusiastic introvert. I think a good first step is improving my linked in and twitter feeds; these seem to be the 
most popular in professional circles. My instagram could also be improved with more social aspects. I think the best way to manage this is to set aside one hour a month
or maybe biweekly to update these platforms and ensure they are putting forth my best foot. With thanksgiving this week, I think I am going to plan the remainder of this
week as an opportunity to get my head on straight and then post monday, my nose to the grindstone. I worry how this will impact my personal relationships but I must trust
if I communicate these difficulties, they will be adequately understanding. Oh I got to get to work.

The much anticipated respite of the long weekend has done wonders for body and soul as I returned home for Thanksgiving. We've had so much to do and perhaps foolishly
enough, I did very little this weekend. I feel rested. Hopeful. That in itself validates the rest in that it may fuel my continued efforts for the foreseeable future. I 
took a page from the presentation last week on networks and orienting yourself with your strengths and have worked on my virtual portfolio. I've reexamined my Linkedin 
and have started a Twitter page and have scheduled a weekly time on Friday to manage them. Research is going well, I've scaled up efforts to do mass transfections of my 
osteosarcomas and my HT1080 parental and hTERT overexpression lines. In the immediate future I will process these into clonogenicity, resazurin, fluoresence, and
validation through qPCR on the knockdowns. I can report with some satisfaction that the knockdown is limiting mitochondria potentiation, although I will need a more robust
technique to validate this. Phenix project remains stalled with the limitation on microscopy facilities though I have my experiment planned. Though the weather worsens
with each passing day, I report that my own spirits remain undisturbed and zealous for tomorrow. Epictetus says, 'Don't explain your philosphy, embody it'. I think the 
simplicity of the Stoics in their mantra is worth pursuing. An enlightenment that requires complex teaching and doctrine must fall away from a suitable path in that it 
remains inaccessible to the masses. What Stoicism speaks of is simply rationality and viewing the world through an empiric lens. Perfect for a scientist and certainly 
available to any person who wishes it. I wonder in what capacity learning of these different perspectives actually impacts my perception of reality or is it moreso in 
retrospection.

This was a long day and very unrepresentative of what I imagine a weekend to be like. I had the pleasure of baking today, cinnamon buns, delicious as promised by my 
imagination and surely a welcome sight for lab tomorrow. Despite this small victory, I find myself rather muted from the work this weekend. 15 hours of lab work alone.
This cannot be sustainable, especially with dry work and anything else I may want to accomplish. I try not to be frustrated or upset. Try to look at it in the Stoic 
lens of it is simply a part of the human experience. As much as the setting sun is part of the normal day, working a weekend here and there, however disappointing is
nothing more than part of what it means to be a person. One should not find frustration in more positive parts of life, and so should try to not be overwhelmed when
more negative things rear their face. If nothing else, it was wholly productive and hopefully I will reap these results this coming week. I can note that for the first 
time in many years I finished reading a book of fiction for my own enjoyment. As recommended by my partner, 'A Court of Roses and Thorns' was enjoyable to read, a bit
~particular~ at some points, but overly pleasant. It served as a gentle reminder to seek balance in my life. At this time my career and academics have dominated most 
of my time. I've tried to make time for physical health with some modest success but creative outlets have been sorely overlooked. I've got some changes to make.

Today was a milestone day in that I finished the first stage of imaging my knockdowns for the Neverland project. Exciting in that I can go a few days without peering 
down a microscope and that I can finally see if this project is going anywhere or needs to be binned. Not exciting because its time to do stats and image analysis on 
some 700 images, each with tens of cells, each with different contexts. It is going to be large effort but I'll see if I can rope my colleagues into helping me. Lately,
mental health has been good. I chalk this up to getting good sleep and plenty of exercise given that the workload is anything but peaceful. Truly humble, I've realized
I know far too little about almost everything so I spent some time in the library and checked out some resources to bolster my knowledge base. It's reminiscent of 
undergraduate with the relearning of the biochemistry and genetics at play but I think it will be beneficial for me. I've been listening to a podcast called 'Fall
of Civilizations' cataloging the details of the rise and fall of the many civilizations around the world, from Inca to Assyrian, from Han Chinese to Greenland Vikings.
It has greatly changed my perception of society as a whole, just in the day to day. I find myself imaging passerby as they would be a thousand years ago. Some students
passed by talking about the latest football game not unlike some locals of Constantinople discussing the results of the latest chariot races. Or someone complaining 
about the carbon tax being wholely similar to a disgruntled lord fuming about excessive taxation by the king. I wonder about my own place in society and our society's 
place in the larger historical context. A citizen of a recently liberated province of the once-burgeoning British empire. Although Canada's liberation from British
rule is far less bloody that historically typical, I wonder what we can expect next in the eternal ebb and flow of regional, and as of the last couple hundred years, 
global, powers of conquest.

Not much to update on, though I have a spare moment to write so I shall. Today was plasmid isolation which is probably my least favourite protocol out there. Yield was
good so hopefully won't have to do that particular plasmid again until after my dissertation. I woke up pretty groggy this morning in stark contrast to yesterday 
brimming with energy. I think that one thing on my mind is the purpose of this exercise. Brought on my the weather more likely than not, I wonder what I'm trying to
accomplish through this exercise. To be more reflective. Well to what end. I suppose that is the purpose of the reflection is it not. For our own benefit, does 
understanding our motives or own nature lend itself in any way to a quantifiable change in your life. Can it bring me fame and riches? Will it make me happier? Or is 
it simply for knowledge sake? For me, I find it mellows out most experiences in the moment and in retrospection which may have benefit in challening stressful moments
or in making decisions with this knowledge at my foundation. Maybe in some way by understanding myself I can make decisions that in my best interest. If done correctly
it may limit the value of future reflection although any deviation from expected benefit would be substantial grounds to adjust the reflection process for better
outcomes.

The marvel of technology strikes yet again as I pass the burden of mundane work unto the computer. I was previously tasked with phenotyping tens of thousands and 
quantifying membrane potential by hand but have been instructed to instead train an artificial intelligence to do it instead. Far cooler and far more time friendly. 
This week has seen many tasks been assigned in the world of writing. My research advisory committee has finally been selected and with that the urgent need to prepare my
project proposal for my research. In addition, my cosupervisor has been invited to produce a review for a journal and indicated I shall lead these efforts. Today I 
submitted the first draft of our plan to the group for review before I begin the drafting process. The transition to winter from fall seems to have happened overnight.
Sunday felt like dawn by 7am, Monday, the sun barely cleared the horizon by 8:30am. Some hyperbole but the point stands. I seem to be less tolerant of the cold with
each passing year. I'm looking forward to an early night with hopefully no shortage of sleep.
