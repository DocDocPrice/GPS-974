This marks the first passage I’ve written on the subject of being a graduate student. Its been about four months since I’ve started this project and in a scary way
that means I only have 32 months left and by that I mean I only have 28 months left. Time has flown by faster than I can imagine and I feel caught between the world 
of doing too little and doing too much. It is probably better summed by having too few results and too little time in the day. I’ve learned a lot in my brief tenure,
plenty of scientific skills that I wouldn’t have thought available, hell, I learned how to anesthetize a mouse. I know I’m going to have to increase my commitment to 
the this project, and that means learning how to better manage my time. I think my biggest issue is the loss to nothing. Time spend on social media, time spent resting,
time doing leisurely things. Time needed for balancing my mental state but time that I cannot affort to continue to lose. Marcus Aurelius said something along the lines
of a man’s value can be somewhat measured by the merit of his actions. What does it say of my own merit being occupied with work? Or maybe worse, spending it in leisure
without substantial production. One avenue I’d like to keep is leisure reading. I find it calming and has the potential to improve my vocabulary, something necessary in 
this career. I may even gain something along the lines of charisma. I could also try experimenting with time blocks and never violating these rules. Something is going 
to have to give if this is going to work out.

Three days pass and my mind is occupied with the ideas of network and image. By virtue of my position, I have somewhat a secure platform to base the next five years of
my career from, but what comes next and how can I maneuver to ensure my most likely outcome is also my most beneficial. The current stance is to network and build a 
community of people, something I have loathed as an enthusiastic introvert. I think a good first step is improving my linked in and twitter feeds; these seem to be the 
most popular in professional circles. My instagram could also be improved with more social aspects. I think the best way to manage this is to set aside one hour a month
or maybe biweekly to update these platforms and ensure they are putting forth my best foot. With thanksgiving this week, I think I am going to plan the remainder of this
week as an opportunity to get my head on straight and then post monday, my nose to the grindstone. I worry how this will impact my personal relationships but I must trust
if I communicate these difficulties, they will be adequately understanding. Oh I got to get to work.

The much anticipated respite of the long weekend has done wonders for body and soul as I returned home for Thanksgiving. We've had so much to do and perhaps foolishly
enough, I did very little this weekend. I feel rested. Hopeful. That in itself validates the rest in that it may fuel my continued efforts for the foreseeable future. I 
took a page from the presentation last week on networks and orienting yourself with your strengths and have worked on my virtual portfolio. I've reexamined my Linkedin 
and have started a Twitter page and have scheduled a weekly time on Friday to manage them. Research is going well, I've scaled up efforts to do mass transfections of my 
osteosarcomas and my HT1080 parental and hTERT overexpression lines. In the immediate future I will process these into clonogenicity, resazurin, fluoresence, and
validation through qPCR on the knockdowns. I can report with some satisfaction that the knockdown is limiting mitochondria potentiation, although I will need a more robust
technique to validate this. Phenix project remains stalled with the limitation on microscopy facilities though I have my experiment planned. Though the weather worsens
with each passing day, I report that my own spirits remain undisturbed and zealous for tomorrow. Epictetus says, 'Don't explain your philosphy, embody it'. I think the 
simplicity of the Stoics in their mantra is worth pursuing. An enlightenment that requires complex teaching and doctrine must fall away from a suitable path in that it 
remains inaccessible to the masses. What Stoicism speaks of is simply rationality and viewing the world through an empiric lens. Perfect for a scientist and certainly 
available to any person who wishes it. I wonder in what capacity learning of these different perspectives actually impacts my perception of reality or is it moreso in 
retrospection.
